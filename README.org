#+TITLE: helm interface to interact with systemd units

This package lets you Start/Restart/Stop and view status of systemd units with helm.

Main keys are ~tab~ to select either of Start/Restart/Stop and ~C-j~ to view the selected unit status in a special buffer. User's units come in a separate source, ~C-o~ to switch to the latter. Systemd unit type (service, timers, mount, etc) can be cycled with ~C-[~ and ~C-]~.

* Configuration

| variable                     | description                        |
|------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| helm-systemd-list-all        | Pass the "--all" option to systemd |

Ideas for improvement go here.
  - Provide feedback on systemd restart/stop status
  - persistent restart/stop actions
  - async action, especially restart
